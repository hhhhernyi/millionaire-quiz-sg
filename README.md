# You want to be millionaire or not?
this is an adaptation of my initial project which was built with vanilla Javascript, based on DO manipulation. 
I decide to redo this project using what i learn in React, styling done is ANTdesign and the live app link is here:
the initial project repo git hub repo is here:

## Game concept
this is based of the very popular, Who wants to be a millionaire? but i made a version that is Singapore specific
## Development
- firstly i have to develop the landing page, where the users will see once they come to the website
- the landing page should have a few functions: 
- let the users see the instructions, let the user start the game, let the user control the volume
- after landing page is done, move to instruction page first since it is easier
- after instruction is done, can move on to main game page
